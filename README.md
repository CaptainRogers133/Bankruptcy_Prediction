# Bankruptcy_Prediction
The objective of my work is to use Under-sampling and Over-Sampling techniques and machine learning models to build predictive models of company  bankruptcy using its financial information. This study aims at predicting business failure. It was conducted using data from 6819 companies  and 96 variables. After cleaning the database, we ended up with 95 variables. Also, given the  imbalance observed in the classes of the variable of interest, we rebalanced the classes in the learning  curve before estimating our different models. From our analysis, it appears that high values of the debt ratio and of the current liabilities to assets ratio are reasons that justify the bankruptcy of  firms. On the other hand, high or increasing net income to total assets and return on assets allow firms to avoid bankruptcy and perform better. Moreover, the estimation of different models revealed that the random forest is the one that best predicts whether firms will fail or not with an  accuracy of 99%, an estimated precision of about 88%, a recall of about 92% and an f1-score of 85%.
